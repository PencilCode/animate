title: Symmetric Drawings
subtitle: repeat steps in reverse order
mission: >
  The dress in this picture should have left-right mirror-image symmetry.
  To do this, the program should also have mirror-image symmetry!
  After line 11 (<code>lt 180, 20</code>), the commands should
  repeat but in reverse order.  Try completing the dress.

    subtitle: finish the drawing with style
    mission: >
      Now that you know how to make it symmetric,
      tailor the shape of the dress as you like.
      Experiment with <code>pen path</code> and
      <code>fill</code> to fill the dress with color,
      and try altering the shape, or use lines or dots
      for other details.  Not everything needs
      to be symmetric.
