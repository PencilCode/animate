subtitle: repeat steps in reverse order
mission: >
  The shirt in this picture should have left-right mirror-image symmetry.
  The program can do this if it also has mirror-image symmetry.
  The commands after the middle (line 12) should repeat the commands
  before the middle, but in reverse order!  Try completing the shirt.

      Now that you know how to make a symmetric shape,
      tailor it as you like.  Can you make other clothes?
      Experiment with <code>pen path</code> and
      <code>fill</code> to fill your creation with color,
      and try altering the shape, or use lines or dots
      for other details.  Not everything needs
      to be symmetric.
