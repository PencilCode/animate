title: Symmetric Drawings
subtitle: repeated steps in reverse order
mission: >
  The dress in this picture should have mirror-image symmetry, with
  the same shape on the left and right.
  To do this, the program should also have mirror-image symmetry!
  Every line after <code>lt 180, 20</code> should repeat
  a line before it, in reverse order. Try completing the dress,
  keeping it symmetric.

    subtitle: finish the drawing with style
    mission: >
      Now that you know how to make it symmetric,
      tailor the shape of the dress as you like.
      The dress will be more interesting with a solid color
      and style.  Experiment with <code>pen path</code> and
      <code>fill</code> to fill the dress with color, and try
      using lines or dots to add edges or other details.
      Not everything needs to be symmetric.
