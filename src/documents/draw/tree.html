title: Tree
subtitle: using recursion
mission: >
  A big tree can be drawn by putting together a few little trees,
  and a little tree can be made out of tiny trees.
  By making a <code>tree</code> function with a <code>size</code> argument,
  we can make a tree out of smaller trees.
  Try using <code>speed</code> to speed up the drawing.

    subtitle: using randomness
    mission: >
      The tree is made of smaller trees, each 3/4 as large as
      the big tree.  In nature, shapes are not perfectly sized.
      Investigate the <code>random</code> function, and try
      varying the ratio so that instead of 3/4 it is random
      number less than 1.
