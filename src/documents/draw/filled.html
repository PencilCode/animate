title: Filled Shapes
mission: >
  Make more complicated filled shapes by
  using an invisible "path" pen with <code>pen path</code>, and then
  using the <code>fill</code> command when the path is complete
  to fill that path with a color.  Try changing the program
  to use a regular color like <code>pen red</code> to see the shape
  traced by the turtle.
instructions:
  - title: Self-Crossing Shapes
    mission: >
      Experiment with filling different shapes and colors.
      Try tracing out a shape that crosses itself and then filling it.
      What is the effect?  Try building a scene that uses both filled
      shapes and line-stroked shapes.
