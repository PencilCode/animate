subtitle: passing functions as arguments
mission: >
  Functions can be arguments.
  <code>starburst</code> draws a burst with any shape at each
  end.  <code>starburst 5, 50, dot</code> draws a default black
  <code>dot</code> at each end.  Can you change the program to draw
  a <code>reddot</code> at each end?

    subtitle: pass a bigger function
    mission: >
      Instead of drawing a dot at each end, try creating a function
      that draws some other shape at each end of the starburst.
      Can you draw a smaller starburst at each end of the big
      starburst?
