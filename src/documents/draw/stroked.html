title: Stroked and Filled Shapes
subtitle: using functions
mission: >
  To have a shape that is both filled and stroked, it has to be drawn
  twice with different pens.  One nice way to do that is to define a
  <em>function</em>, which gives a name like <code>moon</code> to a
  subprogram that you can run whenever you want using <code>do moon</code>.

    mission: >
      Once you have a function to make a shape, you can use it as
      many times as you like.  Try making a picture with many moons
      with different colors around the screen.
  - title: Your Own Function
    subtitle: name your own subprogram
    mission: >
      Copy some code from another drawing here to create your own
      function.  Remember to neatly indent your subprogram when
      you define it, and carefully copy the use of the punctuation
      <code>= -&gt;</code> when you define the function.
