title: Combining Elements
mission: >
  Compose a shape that combines elements such as dots, curves, and lines.
  Can you complete the smiley face?  Adding all the right turns and
  subtracting all the left turns: 50 + 100 - 120 - 42 = -12, which means
  the turtle is pointed left by twelve degrees.  How many degrees
  can make the turtle point directly "west"?
