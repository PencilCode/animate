  A <em>function</em> is just a subprogram that you can make by
  indenting your program after an arrow <code>-&gt;</code>.
  If you name your functions with a definition like
  <code>smiley = -&gt;</code>, you can use your function anywhere
  with <code>do smiley</code>.  Try moving the turtle and
  making a page with several smileys.
