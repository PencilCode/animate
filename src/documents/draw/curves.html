    subtitle: rockets and cars
    mission: >
      Arcs are great for making curvy vehicle shapes.  A rocket might
      begin with <code>rt 45, 200; rt 120; rt 45, 200</code>.
      The wheels of a car might start with
      <code>rt 360,20; lt 90; fd 60; lt 90; rt 540,20</code>.
      Experiment with a rocket or a car.
  - title: Flowers
    subtitle: stems and petals
    mission: >
      Arcs are useful for making organic shapes like a curved stem
      or a round petal of a flower.  A flower with a single
      round petal might look like <code>rt 30,200; rt 360,20</code>.
      Try drawing a flower.  Remember that you can
      switch pen colors in different parts of your drawing.
