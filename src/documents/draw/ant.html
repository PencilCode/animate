    mission: >
      Create a snowman object or a smiley object by
      changing or copying the ant-drawing code.
      After drawing on your new object but before moving it
      you should <code>sync yourobject, turtle</code> so that
      the new object waits to move until after the main
      turtle is finished drawing.
