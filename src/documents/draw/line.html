  - title: Pen Thickness
    mission: >
      Experiment with wider pens and narrower pens. Using a comma,
      you can add a number which is the pen thickness, in pixels:
      <code>pen red, 10</code>.
  - title: Angles
    mission: >
      Experiment with turning the line in a different direction.
      The <a href="/ref/rt.html" target="reference">rt</a>
      and <a href="/ref/rt.html" target="reference">lt</a>
      commands can pivot the turtle in a new direction.  Try
      <code>rt 90</code> or <code>lt 135</code>.  Combine
      several lines and angles to make a shape.
  - title: Speed
    mission: >
      Experiment with faster and slower drawing. You can use
      the command <code>speed 10</code> to tell the turtle
      to do 10 moves per second.
