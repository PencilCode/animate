subtitle: move forward with fd
mission: >
  What happens when you draw a huge dot of size 1000?
  Once you have a nice background, you can draw in white.
  A snowman needs a few dots in different places.
  Experiment with <code>fd</code>, and move the turtle to
  draw a shape with several dots.
instructions:
  - title: Add Buttons
    subtitle: move backwards with bk
    mission: >
      The turtle can be moved backward with <code>bk</code>.
      Try moving it back and adding a few buttons.
  - title: Add a Face
    subtitle: turn with rt and lt
    mission: >
      The turtle can turned right with <code>rt</code> and
      left with <code>lt</code>.  Try adding eyes or a few
      dots for a smile.  To explore another example with
      a smiley face, take a look at <a href="smiley.html">Combining
      Elements</a>.
