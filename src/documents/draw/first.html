title: First Dot
mission: >
  Pick a <a href="/ref/colors.html">color</a> and make a dot.
  Can you see how to adjust the color and the size?
instructions:
  - title: Donut
    mission: >
      Try drawing a second dot by adding a second line to your
      program.  Make a donut by drawing a smaller dot on top of
      a bigger dot.  To clear the middle, you can draw in
      <code>white</code> or even in a special color called
      <code>erase</code>.
  - title: Bullseye
    mission: >
      Try drawing many dots of different sizes.  By alternating
      light and dark colors, you can make a bullseye.  Or by
      using a series of dots slightly smaller than each other,
      you can make beautiful striped patterns.
