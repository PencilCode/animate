subtitle: using function arguments
mission: >
  Functions can take inputs (called <em>arguments</em>).  This function
  has one argument <code>n</code> that tells how many
  corners are drawn.  Can you draw a 5-pointed star?  An 8-pointed star?

    subtitle: adding more arguments
    mission: >
      Add more arguments by declaring <code>star = (n, m, s) -&gt;</code>.
      <code>m</code> can be the number multiplied by 360 when
      calculating the angle, and <code>s</code> could be the length
      of a side.  Now can you draw an 8-pointed star?
subtitle: using function arguments
mission: >
  Functions can take inputs (called <em>arguments</em>).  This function
  has one argument <code>n</code> that is used to count how many
  corners are drawn in the star.  Experiment with this function
  to make a star.  Can you draw a five-pointed star or a nine-pointed
  star?  Does it work for all numbers?
