title: Custom Star
subtitle: using function arguments
mission: >
  Functions can take inputs (called <em>arguments</em>).  This function
  has one argument <code>n</code> that tells how many
  corners are drawn.  Can you draw a 5-pointed star?  An 8-pointed star?
instructions:
  - title: Super Star
    subtitle: adding more arguments
    mission: >
      Add more arguments by declaring <code>star = (n, m, s) -&gt;</code>.
      <code>m</code> can be the number multiplied by 360 when
      calculating the angle, and <code>s</code> could be the length
      of a side.  Now can you draw an 8-pointed star?
  - title: Twinkle faster
    subtitle: using speed to try ideas faster
    mission: >
      Remember that you can use <code>speed</code> to see what your ideas
      do faster. Try <code>speed 5</code> to watch the turtle travel more
      quickly, and <code>speed Infinity</code> to draw everything instantly.

  Functions can take inputs (called <em>arguments</em>).  This function
  has one argument <code>n</code> that is used to count how many
  corners are drawn in the star.  Can you draw a five-pointed star or
  a nine-pointed star?  Can you make it work for all numbers?
