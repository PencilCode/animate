title: Repeated Parts
subtitle: from Teenage Dream by Katy Perry
mission: >
  Teenage Dream has a repeated chord that goes
  for the whole song. This
  program repeats the chord by defining the
  variable <code>b</code>, and then playing
  <code>p.play b+b+b+b+b+b+b+b+b</code>.
  The melody is played by a second piano.
  What happens when you change the definition
  of <code>b</code>?

    subtitle: can you play Happy?
    mission: >
      Try extending the the tune and make your own
      question-and-answer melodies.
      It takes a good ear and a lot of hard work
      to create a number one hit riff!
