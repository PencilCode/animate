  - title: Question and Answer
    subtitle: a musical back and forth
    mission: >
      Happy has a question-answer theme, answering
      a melody in high octaves by a tune in the low octaves.
      This program sets up variables <code>t</code>, <code>t2</code>,
      <code>intro</code>, <code>q1</code>, <code>q2</code>,
      <code>q3</code>, <code>q4</code>, <code>a</code>,
      <code>a2</code>, and <code>b</code> for different parts.
      Try playing and combining them at the bottom
      by changing the song on line 25.
  - title: Extend the Tune
    subtitle: can you play Happy?
    mission: >
      Try extending the the tune and make your own
      question-and-answer melodies.
      It takes a good ear and a lot of experimentation
      to create a catchy riff!
