        The most memorable parts of Pharrell Williams song are a
        musical back-and-forth.  Each phrase starts something like this:
        <code>_E/_A/A/Z/AZ/E/E/E/F/F</code>
        or this: <code>C/F/FFC/C/C/_E/E/F</code> (an octave higher),
        with this sort of answer: <code>F_A_BA/C'BAB/AF</code>
        (an octave lower).
