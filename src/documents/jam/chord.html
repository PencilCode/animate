    subtitle: add more notes for richer sound
    mission: >
      A four-note chord can sound richer than a three-note chord.
      Try adding lower notes to the chords such as <code>F,</code> or
      <code>C,</code>.  A comma after a note makes it an octave lower.

  p = new Piano
  p.play "[FAC']4[GEC']4"
