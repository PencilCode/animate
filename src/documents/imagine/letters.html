subtitle: carefully arranging text on the page
mission: >
  The <code>type</code> command types letters in a <em>monospace</em>
  font, which means that every letter takes up the same space,
  like on a typewriter.
  To write many lines of text at once, surround the text
  with triple-quotes <code>"""</code>.

instructions:
  - title: Formatting with HTML
    subtitle: paragraphs and styles
    mission: >
      You can include <em>HTML tags</em> such as
      <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>
      in text you <code>write</code>.
      <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> makes a paragraph.
      <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> makes bolded text.
      Experiment with HTML tags.
