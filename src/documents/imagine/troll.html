  - title: Add more personality.
    mission: >
      The troll would have more personality if it had more
      things to say.  What should it say if you try to "go"
      without permission?  Or what should it say if you try
      to "hit" the troll?
  - title: Change the conversation.
    mission: >
      The troll program is called a "chatbot".  Chatbots can
      have all sorts of conversations, not just riddles, and
      some chatbots are good enough that they can fool you
      into thinking they are really a person.  Can you make a
      chatbot that chats like a person?
