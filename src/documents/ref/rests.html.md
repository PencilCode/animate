A rest is a pause in a melody when there is a break in the sound for a
particular musical phrase.

Rests in a musical phrase hold silence for some number of beats,
but they do not indicate a break anywhere else in the melody.

A single beat of rest is written `Z`.

<pre class="jumbo">
play "G G <span data-dfn="one beat of rest">Z</span> G G"
</pre>

<h3>Longer and Shorter Rests</h3>

A rest can be followed by
a number or fraction for a different number of beats of silence.

<pre class="jumbo">
play """
  D''/2 B'/2 <span data-dfnup="three beats of rest">Z3</span>
  D''/2 B'/2 Z3
  Z3/2 E''/2
  G''/2 <span data-dfn="half beat of rest">Z/2</span> G''
"""</pre>

<h3>Staccato</h3>

If you are using rests to separate notes to create a "plucky" sound,
consider using <a href="staccato.html">staccato</a> notation instead.
