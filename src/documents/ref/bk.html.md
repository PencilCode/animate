<b>bk</b> tells the turtle to move <mark>b</mark>ac<mark>k</mark>ward.

The distance is measured in pixels.

<code class="jumbo">bk&nbsp;<span data-dfn="distance">100</span></code>

If a pen is selected, the turtle will draw a line as it moves.

<pre class="jumbo"><span data-dfn="pick a pen">pen red</span>

bk <span data-dfn="longer">200</a></pre>

If the turtle is turned, it will move in the reverse of the direction it points.

<pre class="jumbo"><span data-dfn="turn the turtle">rt 135</span>

bk <span data-dfn="short">50</span></pre>
