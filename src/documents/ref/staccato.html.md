A staccato mark is used to separate notes in a sharp "popping"
sound similar to a hand clap. This dynamic can occur at any
volume or tempo.

To play a staccato note in ABC notation, put a dot before
the note. A note with accidentals or any duration can be
made staccato by starting with a dot.

The term "staccato" comes from the Italian word meaning "detached".
