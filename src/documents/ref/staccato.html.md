The term "staccato" comes from the Italian word meaning "detached".

A staccato mark is used to separate notes in a sharp "popping"
sound similar to a hand clap. This dynamic can occur at any
volume or tempo.

To play a staccato note in ABC notation, put a dot before
the note.

A staccato dot is written before any accidentals.

To separate longer notes, use <a href="rests.html">rests</a>.
