<h3>Letter Notes</h3>

Since ancient Rome, letters have been used to represent musical pitches.
The modern convention is to use the letters A through G, centered around
the C major scale (so that A and B are higher than G):

<pre class="jumbo">
play "CDEFG<span data-dfn="higher than G">ABC'</span>"
</pre>

Here we are using "ABC" notation, which is a specific technical notation
for typing music on the internet.  It adopts the convention of
capital `C` for middle C, a frequency of about 261.62 Hertz.

Notes can be changed by [octaves](octaves.html),
[sharps](sharps.html), and [flats](flats.html).
