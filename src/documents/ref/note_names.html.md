<h3>Letter Notes</h3>

Since ancient Rome, letters have been used to represent musical pitches.
The modern convention is to use the letters A through G, centered around
the C major scale (so that A and B are higher than G):

<pre class="jumbo">
play "CDEFG<span data-dfn="higher than G">ABC'</span>"
</pre>

Here we are using "ABC" notation, which is a specific technical notation
for typing music on the internet.  It adopts the convention of
capital `C` for middle C, a frequency of about 261.62 Hertz.

Notes can be changed by [octaves](octaves.html),
[sharps](sharps.html), and [flats](flats.html).

<h3>Did You Know?</h3>

Composers for centuries have tried to place messages in their music
by spelling out names of people (usually themselves) in a repeating
melody. This is sometimes called musical cryptography.
Johann Sebastian Bach (spelled out “B A C” and then used another
note to represent the H of his last name in a number of pieces.
Because most music was written down by hand before internet and
television were available, it was a sign of musical mastery to hide
words in the music and for musicians to notice the code in the
work of their peers.

Does this work for your name?  What about a nickname or favorite place?
