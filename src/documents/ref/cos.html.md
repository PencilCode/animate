`cos x` computes the cosine of the angle `x`, where `x` is measured
in degrees:

<pre class="jumbo">
write cos 90
</pre>

To compute the cosine in radians, you can use `Math.cos` instead:

<pre class="jumbo">
write Math.cos PI/2
</pre>

Other trigonometric functions include
[`sin`](sin.html) and [`tan`](tan.html).
